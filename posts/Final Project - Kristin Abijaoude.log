[]\T1/lmtt/m/n/10 Each country handles citizenship and immigration differently.
 Some countries permit dual citizenship, while others restrict how many nationa
lities their citizens can have. Some countries give unconditional citizenship t
o any child born on their soil, while others do if their parents are citizens. 
Finally, there are countries that only restrict the path to citizenship to cert
ain races, ethnic, or religious groups.[]

[]\T1/lmtt/m/n/10 A citizenship is a contract between the citizen and the count
ry. The citizen pledges allegiance to the []\T1/lmtt/b/n/10 country[] \T1/lmtt/
m/n/10 (or countries); and in turn, the []\T1/lmtt/b/n/10 country[] \T1/lmtt/m/
n/10 (or countries) provide rights and protections for the citizen. For example
, I am a dual American-Lebanese citizen; I was born in America, which provides 
unconditional birthright citizenship, and my parents passed the Lebanese nation
ality down to my sisters and me. The allegiance between the citizen and the cou
ntry can break, just like a contract. In several cases, the citizenship can be 
revoked, from voluntary renunciation of a citizenship or involuntary renunciati
on due to disloyalty, criminal offenses, or even having dual citizenship. Note 
the word ^^Pseveral^^Q since the situation like this is on a case-by-case analy
sis. Out of curiosity and interest, the purpose of this report is to analyze th
e bureaucratic nature of citizenship and immigration.[]

[]\T1/lmtt/m/n/10 To make this report easier for the reader, as well as myself,
 I will be broadly focusing on whether the citizenship laws are enforced, regar
dless of the exceptions in place. For example, if a country allows parents to p
ass down citizenship to their children, I will classify that as ^^Pyes^^Q, even
 if there's an age limit to receiving citizenship, or if a country allows dual 
citizenship with certain countries, I will classify that as ^^PYes^^Q as in the
y allow dual citizenship. However, I will keep the original dataset to manipula
te more variables later.[]
